# todolist advanced

this is the same as the todo list with extra features.
in this one you can show and hide details of each list.
you can add new todo lists.
you can delete todo lists.
you can update todolists.

when you click on cancel any change that you have done to a todo list will be brought back to before the changes state.
when you click on update you changes will be saved in the system.

i hope you like it <3.
